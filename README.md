Dataset containing all of the fire insidents in the Pittsburgh area: https://data.wprdc.org/datastore/dump/8d76ac6b-5ae8-4428-82a4-043130d17b02

Using the datasets from the neighborhoods of Pittsburgh, we have determined the best neighborhood to be North Oakland. Our measure of "bestness" is defined by our metric of safety. We came to this conclusion after reviewing the data on fire incidents and arrests in the neighborhoods and analzed the data in terms of population density.
