Dataset containing all of the fire incidents in the Pittsburgh area: https://data.wprdc.org/datastore/dump/8d76ac6b-5ae8-4428-82a4-043130d17b02

Using the datasets from the neighborhoods of Pittsburgh, we have determined the best neighborhood to be North Oakland. Our measure of "bestness" is defined by our metric of safety and affordability. We came to this conclusion after reviewing the data on fire incidents and arrests in the neighborhoods and analyzed the data in terms of population density.



We measured safety through the occurrences of arrests and fire per 1000 people. We chose to use arrests as a measurement of both police and criminal activity, both of which lower the overall safety of an area. Fire was chosen to represent the quality of housing in the area, and the likeliness of your house (if you lived in that neighborhood) to be dangerous.



We measured affordability through the average household income of the neighborhood. Our logic was that an area with high household income would meet that level by having more expensive homes, goods, etc. Therefore, areas with lower household income would be more affordable to live in.



Our overall score was determined by add the affordability score to the safety score.
